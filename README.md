# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction  
It is a Linear Regression Model to predict home prices in the city of Bengaluru. The dataset used is kaggle's "Bengaluru House Price Data".  
I have used pandas, numpy and matplotlib for data cleaning and outlier removal. GridSearchCV to find the best regression model which fits our data.
Linear Regression fit our data pretty well. So I have used sklearn to model and train Linear Regression.  
I have used Flask for the website which uses our ml model to predict property prices.
